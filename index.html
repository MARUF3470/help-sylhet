                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>At first we want to arrange food for every family. We can clearly see that people want food more than anything in this flood crysis in Sylhet. People are starving from many days as they can't have food and also they can't have the way to cook. So it is our first piority to use the donation money to arrange food for as many as family we can</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>There are so many families who have lost their houses in this flood. They don't have place to live now. They took shelter in schools or in cyclone shelters. So our second piority is to make houses for them so that they can have a parmanent shelter to live</p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>After this flood we can clearly understand that so many younge children will drop-out from schools for their proverty. This is not a good sign for the future of a county. To secure their future we also want to use the donation money in the education system</p>
